            About This Project

            This website provides a simple online SWOT analysis tool designed to help individuals and teams make better
            decisions.

            SWOT analysis is a widely used strategic planning method that evaluates:

            Strengths

            Weaknesses

            Opportunities

            Threats

            The goal of this project is to make strategic thinking easier and more accessible without requiring
            accounts, subscriptions, or complex software.

            The tool can be used for:

            product planning

            personal decisions

            business ideas

            education and learning

            team discussions

            This project is an independent tool created to simplify structured thinking and decision-making.
