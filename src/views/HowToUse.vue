            How to Use SWOT Analysis

            SWOT analysis is a simple framework used to evaluate a situation or idea before making a decision.

            Step 1 — Strengths

            Write what works well.
            What advantages do you have?

            Examples:

            skills

            resources

            experience

            unique features

            Step 2 — Weaknesses

            Identify limitations or problems.

            Examples:

            lack of time

            missing knowledge

            budget constraints

            Step 3 — Opportunities

            Think about external factors that may help you succeed.

            Examples:

            market demand

            trends

            partnerships

            Step 4 — Threats

            Consider risks or obstacles.

            Examples:

            competition

            costs

            external changes

            After filling all sections, compare the items and decide which direction is most reasonable.
